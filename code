# Now that the FIFA World Cup is underway in Russia, billions of people around the globe will be watching the matches 
# and trying to predict the tournament champion. But for those of you who aren’t international soccer fanatics, here’s a question: 
# what if you could predict which teams will excel in the competition simply by examining some non-soccer related statistics?

# Let’s take a closer look at some demographic data from the 32 nations who are competing in this year’s World Cup tournament.

# Here’s how we’ll approach the problem: we’ll pick out five demographic statistics to examine for each of this year’s qualifying 
# countries. We’ll order these nations in each category and compute the percentile ranking for each one. 
# Then we’ll compare these numbers against similar demographic information of past World Cup champions.

# In our analysis, we’ll identify a “sweet spot” in which former World Cup champions (since 1962) have positioned themselves in each 
# statistical category. Then we’ll see which of our 32 entrants are the most similar demographically.

#Let's first load in our packages.
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")

library(tidyverse)

# Next, I navigated to the World Bank DataBank website [http://databank.worldbank.org] and downloaded data pertaining to:
# 1. Population, total
# 2. Population, male (% of total)
# 3. International tourism, number of arrivals
# 4. Cost of damage due to carbon dioxide emissions (% of GNI)
# 5. Birth rate, crude (per 1,000 people)

#... for the World Cup years from 1962 through 2014 AND 2016 (the most recent year available)

# Here's a preview of what the data looked like after creating a pivot table in Excel:
#####
# I loaded all of the csv files into the R GUI...


MalePop <- read.csv("MalePopClean.csv")
Pov <- read.csv("PovertyClean.csv")
Tour <- read.csv("TourismClean.csv")
BRate <- read.csv("BirthRateClean.csv")
Pollution <- read.csv("PollutionClean.csv")

#Then I created a file of all of the World Cup qualifying teams throughout the tournament's history (79 of them), 
#along with the years they qualified and loaded that file as well.

WCupteams <- read.csv("WorldCupQualifiers.csv")

#Then I merged the demographic datasets with the list of the World Cup qualifiers
# while eliminating all of the other nations who never qualified
WCUP <- merge(x=WCupteams, y=Pov, by = c("Country.Name", "year"), all.x = TRUE)
WCUP <- merge(x=WCUP, y=MalePop, by = c("Country.Name", "year"), all.x = TRUE)
WCUP <- merge(x=WCUP, y=Tour, by = c("Country.Name", "year"), all.x = TRUE)
WCUP <- merge(x=WCUP, y=BRate, by = c("Country.Name", "year"), all.x = TRUE)
WCUP <- merge(x=WCUP, y=Pollution, by = c("Country.Name", "year"), all.x = TRUE)

#Next, I had to maually create a column [WCUP$RESULTt] which represented how each team fared in each year's tournament
# I used Q for Qualifier, A for Absent (did not qualify that year)
# C for Champion, R for Runner-up

#Then I eliminated the rows which featured a country in a year when it did not qualify for the World Cup
WCUPP <- subset(WCUP, RESULT != "A")

# ONe more feature to be added: the number of teams which participated in each World Cup tournament. 
Prior to 1980, there were 16 qualifying teams; 24 teams from 1982-1994; and 32 teams from 1998-present.

WCALLQ$NoTeams <- ifelse(WCALLQ$year < 1979, 16, (ifelse(WCALLQ$year > 1995, 32,24)))

# Then I subseted each year from the dataset

WCup16 <- subset(WCUPP, year == 1962)
WCup16 <- subset(WCUPP, year == 1966)
WCup16 <- subset(WCUPP, year == 1970)
WCup16 <- subset(WCUPP, year == 1974)....
....WCup16 <- subset(WCUPP, year == 2014)
WCup16 <- subset(WCUPP, year == 2016)

## NOTE: Since the year 2016 is the most current for which demographic data is available,
## I used those stats for the 2018 World Cup tournament.

#Now I have a dataset for each World Cup year which allows me to compare all qualifying teams with each demographic feature.

## Time for the sorting!
# First, I will sort each dataset by one feature and give each team a rank

WCup62$RankP <- rank(order(WCup62$Population))

# Then I'll assign these rankings a percentile rank

WCup62$QRankP <- (WCup62$NoTeams - WCup62$RankP + 1)/ WCA70$NoTeams

# I'll do this for each feature...
WCup62$RankMP <- rank(order(WCup62$MalePct))

WCup62$RankX <- rank(order(WCup62$PolIndex))
WCup62$QRankX <- (WCup62$NoTeams - WCup62$RankX + 1)/ WCup62$NoTeams

# and do this for each year's dataset...
WCup66$RankMP <- rank(order(WCup66$MalePct))
WCup66$QRankMP <- (WCup66$NoTeams - WCup66$RankMP + 1)/ WCup66$NoTeams

WCup16$RankMP <- rank(order(WCup16$MalePct))
WCup16$QRankMP <- (WCup16$NoTeams - WCup16$RankMP + 1)/ WCup16$NoTeams

# Now, it's time to recombine the yearly dataset into one big dataset...

WCupData <- rbind(WCup62,WCup66,WCup70,WCup74,WCup78,WCup82,WCup86,WCup90,WCup94,WCup98,WCup02,WCup06,WCup10,WCup14,WCup16)

#The next step is to compare this new percentile-ranked-by-feature dataset with 
# a subset of this dataset made up of ONLY the World Cup champions

WCupChamps <- subset(WCupData, RESULT == "C")

# One more column: one which concatenated the team name and the year in which they qualified

WCupChamps$teamyear <- paste(WCupChamps$Country.Name, WCupChamps$year)
